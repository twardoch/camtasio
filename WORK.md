# Camtasio Work Progress

## 2025-08-03: Final Cleanup and Pre-Release Polish

### Current Status
- âœ… v1.2.0 is feature-complete.
- ðŸ”„ Focus is now on final code quality, documentation, and deployment preparation.
- âœ… The `WORK.md` file is now up-to-date with the project's actual status.

### Work Completed (Cleanup Phase)
- âœ… **Redundant Directory Removal:** Consolidated test suites by deleting the `tests_new` directory.
- âœ… **Legacy File Cleanup:** Confirmed that legacy packaging files (`setup.py`, `setup.cfg`) have been removed.
- âœ… **Build Artifact Cleanup:** Confirmed that temporary build/test artifacts like `htmlcov` and `~` backup files are not present in the repository.

### Next Steps (From TODO.md)

My immediate focus will be on the "Code Quality Improvements" and "Deployment Preparation" sections of `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`.

1.  **Code Maintainability:**
    - [ ] Enable and address errors from `mypy` strict mode (currently 74 errors).
    - [ ] Design and implement a custom exception hierarchy for more specific error handling.

2.  **Testing Enhancement:**
    - [ ] Increase test coverage from the current 28% to over 90%.
    - [ ] Implement property-based testing with `hypothesis` to catch more edge cases.
    - [ ] Add performance benchmarks to track and prevent regressions.

3.  **Documentation:**
    - [ ] Generate API documentation using Sphinx.
    - [ ] Create comprehensive contribution guidelines.

4.  **Deployment:**
    - [ ] Perform a final code quality review.
    - [ ] Conduct a security audit of all dependencies.
    - [ ] Prepare the package for publication to PyPI.
