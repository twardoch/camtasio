- Covered error handling, edge cases, and different parameter combinations
- **Impact**: Single biggest coverage improvement (+67 percentage points for CLI)

#### 2. Complete Factory Module Tests (Coverage: 8% â†’ 100%)
- **Added 28 new test methods** for factory functions
- Comprehensive testing of `create_media_from_dict` with all media types:
  - VideoMedia (VMFile, ScreenVMFile, UnifiedMedia, Group, StitchedMedia)
  - AudioMedia (AMFile) with channel configuration
  - ImageMedia (IMFile) with trim settings
  - Callout media with definition data
- Full testing of `detect_media_type` with all source track combinations
- Edge cases: unknown types, missing data, default values
- **Impact**: Factory module now at 100% coverage

#### 3. Complete JSON Encoder Tests (Coverage: 24% â†’ 100%)
- **Added 15 new test methods** for CamtasiaJSONEncoder
- Comprehensive testing of special float value handling:
  - Positive/negative infinity conversion
  - NaN handling and conversion to 0.0
  - Nested structure preprocessing
  - Complex project data scenarios
- Tested both `encode()` and `iterencode()` methods
- Edge cases: empty structures, large numbers, zero values
- **Impact**: JSON encoder now at 100% coverage

### Documentation Updates
- âœ… Updated CHANGELOG.md with quality regression fixes
- âœ… Cleaned up PLAN.md and TODO.md (removed completed regression tasks)
- âœ… Updated status to focus on Phase 2 production readiness

## 2025-08-04: Quality Regression Fixes and Restoration

### Current Status (Post-Session)
- âœ… All tests now passing! (196 passed, 0 failed, 57 skipped)
- âœ… Ruff violations resolved (zero violations)
- âœ… Type safety fully restored! (zero mypy errors)
- âœ… Test coverage at 55%

### Work Completed in Current Session

#### Quality Regression Analysis
- Identified regressions from v2025.0.7:
  - 1 new test failure (test_keyframe_scaling_temporal)
  - 265 ruff violations (regression from 0)
  - 20 mypy errors (regression from 2)

#### Fixes Applied
1. **Ruff Violations Fixed** (265 â†’ 0)
   - Auto-fixed 261 violations using `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes`
   - Manually fixed 4 B015 violations (pointless comparisons in test_timing.py)
   - All code quality checks now pass

2. **Test Failure Fixed** (1 â†’ 0)
   - Fixed temporal keyframe scaling in PropertyTransformer
   - Added special handling for keyframes list in temporal transforms
   - Keyframe time values now properly scale with temporal factor

3. **Mypy Errors Fixed** (20 â†’ 0)
   - Fixed return type annotation in json_handler.py
   - Added mypy configuration to ignore missing imports for third-party libraries
   - All type checking now passes with strict mode

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with "Unreleased" section documenting regressions
- Cleaned up PLAN.md and TODO.md, removing completed Phase 1 tasks
- Restructured documentation to focus on immediate issues and Phase 2 goals

## Previous Session: 2025-08-04 Morning

### Work Completed (v2025.0.7 Release)
- âœ… **Test Suite Fixes:** Fixed all 13 failing tests
  - Fixed CLI test for missing required fields handling
  - Fixed media operations tests (6 tests) - corrected dictionary iteration
  - Fixed timing/FrameStamp tests (4 tests) - updated to expect proper error handling
  - Fixed serialization tests (2 tests) - improved JSON formatting with orjson/json fallback
- âœ… **Code Quality:** Resolved all 409 auto-fixable ruff violations
- âœ… **Type Safety:** Reduced mypy errors from 71 to just 2

## 2025-08-03: Final Cleanup and Pre-Release Polish

### Work Completed (Cleanup Phase)
- âœ… **Redundant Directory Removal:** Consolidated test suites by deleting the `tests_new` directory.
- âœ… **Legacy File Cleanup:** Confirmed that legacy packaging files (`setup.py`, `setup.cfg`) have been removed.
- âœ… **Build Artifact Cleanup:** Confirmed that temporary build/test artifacts like `htmlcov` and `~` backup files are not present in the repository.

## Next Steps (Phase 2 - Production Readiness)

### Immediate Priority
1. **Test Coverage Improvement** (Current: 55%, Target: >80%)
   - Add tests for uncovered modules (especially CLI with only 4% coverage)
   - Create integration tests for real project files
   - Add edge case and error handling tests
   - Implement property-based testing with hypothesis

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Complete API documentation with comprehensive docstrings
   - Create user guide with practical examples
   - Write CLI reference documentation
   - Set up Sphinx for auto-generated docs

3. **Package Release Preparation**
   - Validate hatch build system configuration
   - Test package installation process locally
   - Create release checklist
   - Prepare for PyPI publication

### Notes
- Quality baseline has been fully restored to exceed v2025.0.7 standards
- All immediate regressions have been fixed
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2 production readiness tasks
- Focus should shift from fixing issues to adding value and increasing coverage
