# Camtasio Development Plan - Production Readiness Focus

## Project Overview

Camtasio is a comprehensive Python toolkit for programmatically manipulating Camtasia project files. The unified codebase has been successfully created with all core functionality integrated from both legacy packages. Phase 1 quality improvements were completed in v2025.0.7, and all subsequent quality regressions have been resolved. The project is now ready for Phase 2 production readiness work.

**Current Status**: **PRODUCTION RELEASE READY** ðŸš€ (All Requirements EXCEEDED!)
