# Camtasio Development Plan - Production Readiness Focus

## Project Overview

Camtasio is a comprehensive Python toolkit for programmatically manipulating Camtasia project files. The unified codebase has been successfully created with all core functionality integrated from both legacy packages. However, immediate focus is required on resolving critical quality issues to achieve production readiness.

**Current Status**: v2025.0.5 - Quality Crisis Resolution Required
**Focus**: Fix failing tests, resolve code quality issues, achieve production stability

## Phase 1: Critical Issues Resolution (IMMEDIATE - Week 1)

### 1.1 Test Suite Emergency Repair (Critical Priority)
- **Current Crisis**: 7 test collection errors preventing any test execution
- **Goal**: Restore functional test suite
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - All tests can be collected and run
  - Basic test coverage reporting functional
  - No import errors or missing dependencies
  - Baseline test coverage measurement established

#### Test Repair Actions (Target: 3-5 days)
**Immediate Fixes Required**
- Fix import errors preventing test collection
- Resolve missing test dependencies and fixture issues
- Update test configuration in pyproject.toml
- Ensure all test modules can import camtasio package correctly
- **Milestone**: `python -m pytest tests/` completes without collection errors

**Essential Test Coverage**
- Verify core API functionality (Project, Timeline, Media models)
- Test basic serialization (load/save operations)
- Test CLI commands can execute without crashing
- Test scaling operations with simple cases
- **Target**: Achieve >50% line coverage for critical paths

### 1.2 Code Quality Crisis Resolution (High Priority)
- **Current State**: 182 ruff violations, 78 mypy errors
- **Goal**: Achieve clean, professional code quality standards
- **Target Timeline**: 5-7 days

#### Automated Code Fixes (Target: 1-2 days)
**Ruff Linting Resolution**
- Run `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes` to auto-resolve 141 fixable issues
- Manually fix remaining 41 issues (undefined names, unsorted imports, etc.)
- Address 115 blank line whitespace issues
- Fix 15 non-PEP585 annotations (list[str] instead of List[str])
- **Milestone**: Zero ruff violations with current rule set

**Import and Structure Cleanup**
- Organize imports using ruff's isort integration
- Remove unused imports and undefined references
- Ensure consistent import order across all modules
- Fix __all__ exports ordering
- **Target**: Clean, professional import structure

#### Type Safety Implementation (Target: 3-5 days)
**MyPy Error Resolution Strategy**
- Categorize 78 current errors by module and error type
- Add missing type annotations for public API methods
- Fix Optional/Union type usage issues
- Address Generic type parameters in transform engine
- **Priority Order**: models → serialization → operations → CLI → tests
- **Milestone**: <10 mypy errors remaining with strict configuration

**Type System Modernization**
- Replace deprecated typing constructs (Dict→dict, List→list, Union→|)
- Add proper return type annotations to all public methods
- Implement TypedDict for JSON structure definitions
- Create Protocol interfaces for pluggable components
- **Target**: Modern Python 3.11+ type system throughout

## Phase 2: Production Readiness (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Test Coverage & Validation
- **Goal**: Establish comprehensive test coverage for production confidence
- **Current**: Tests not running, coverage unknown
- **Success Criteria**:
  - >80% line coverage for core modules (models, serialization, operations)
  - All CLI commands tested with real project files
  - Integration tests for load/save round trips
  - Performance benchmarks for typical operations

#### Essential Test Implementation (Target: 5-7 days)
**Core Functionality Testing**
- Project loading/saving with various Camtasia versions
- Media operations (add, remove, duplicate) with integrity checks
- Scaling operations (spatial and temporal) with validation
- CLI command execution with proper error handling
- **Infrastructure**: Automated test data generation and cleanup

**Error Handling & Edge Cases**
- Malformed project file handling
- Missing media file scenarios
- Invalid parameter ranges for operations
- Filesystem permission and access issues
- **Standard**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages

### 2.2 Documentation & Packaging
- **Goal**: Professional package ready for distribution
- **Timeline**: 3-5 days

#### Documentation Essentials
**API Documentation**
- Complete docstrings for all public classes and methods
- Usage examples for core operations (load, scale, save)
- CLI command reference with practical examples
- Error codes and troubleshooting guide
- **Standard**: Auto-generated docs with sphinx

**User-Facing Documentation**
- Updated README.md with installation and quickstart
- CHANGELOG.md with proper semantic versioning
- Contributing guidelines for community participation
- License and security documentation
- **Goal**: Clear, professional project presentation

### 2.3 Release Preparation
- **Goal**: Stable, distributable package
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days

#### Package Distribution
**Build System Validation**
- Verify hatch + hatch-vcs version management
- Test package building and installation locally
- Validate entry points and CLI functionality
- Check dependency specifications and compatibility
- **Deliverable**: Clean sdist and wheel builds

**Quality Assurance**
- Final linting and type checking passes
- Test suite execution with >80% success rate
- Security audit of dependencies
- Performance validation with typical project files
- **Milestone**: Production-ready release candidate

## Future Roadmap (Post-Production)
