Read @PLAN.md & @TODO.md and review the `llms.txt` codebase snapshot. 

Then /report and /cleanup : Actually REMOVE everything that is completed from @PLAN.md and from @TODO.md , only keep tasks that are not addressed yet! 

Update /plan in @PLAN.md and @TODO.md â€” focus on CLEANING UP the codebase of REDUNDANT, or OBSOLETE files. Think hard. Then also /plan additional improvements that aim at delivering solid, performant, clean, reliable maintainable code. 

Then /work and periodically /report and /cleanup and then rhink hard and /work more. 

Iterate until you've cleaned up 100% of the tasks from @PLAN.md & @TODO.md
