# Camtasio TODO List - Production Readiness Focus

**Current Version**: v2025.0.5
**Focus**: Resolve critical issues, achieve production stability

## Phase 1: Critical Issues Resolution (IMMEDIATE - Week 1)

### Test Suite Emergency Repair (Critical Priority)
- [ ] Fix 7 test collection errors preventing test execution
- [ ] Resolve import errors in test modules
- [ ] Update test configuration in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Ensure all test modules can import camtasio package
- [ ] Establish baseline test coverage measurement
- [ ] **Milestone**: `python -m pytest tests/` runs without collection errors

### Essential Test Coverage
- [ ] Test core API functionality (Project, Timeline, Media models)
- [ ] Test basic serialization (load/save operations)  
- [ ] Test CLI commands execute without crashing
- [ ] Test scaling operations with simple cases
- [ ] **Target**: Achieve >50% line coverage for critical paths

### Code Quality Crisis Resolution (High Priority)

#### Automated Code Fixes (1-2 days)
- [ ] Run `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes` to auto-resolve 141 fixable issues
- [ ] Manually fix remaining 41 ruff violations
- [ ] Address 115 blank line whitespace issues
- [ ] Fix 15 non-PEP585 annotations (List→list, Dict→dict)
- [ ] Fix 13 optional annotation patterns
- [ ] **Milestone**: Zero ruff violations with current rule set

#### Import and Structure Cleanup
- [ ] Organize imports using ruff's isort integration
- [ ] Remove unused imports and undefined references
- [ ] Fix __all__ exports ordering
- [ ] Ensure consistent import order across modules
- [ ] **Target**: Clean, professional import structure

#### Type Safety Implementation (3-5 days)
- [ ] Categorize 78 mypy errors by module and error type
- [ ] Add missing type annotations for public API methods
- [ ] Fix Optional/Union type usage issues
- [ ] Address Generic type parameters in transform engine
- [ ] Replace deprecated typing (Dict→dict, List→list, Union→|)
- [ ] Add return type annotations to all public methods
- [ ] **Priority Order**: models → serialization → operations → CLI → tests
- [ ] **Milestone**: <10 mypy errors remaining with strict configuration

## Phase 2: Production Readiness (Week 2-3)

### Test Coverage & Validation

#### Essential Test Implementation (5-7 days)
- [ ] Test project loading/saving with various Camtasia versions
- [ ] Test media operations (add, remove, duplicate) with integrity checks
- [ ] Test scaling operations (spatial and temporal) with validation
- [ ] Test CLI command execution with proper error handling
- [ ] Set up automated test data generation and cleanup
- [ ] **Target**: >80% line coverage for core modules

#### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Test malformed project file handling
- [ ] Test missing media file scenarios
- [ ] Test invalid parameter ranges for operations
- [ ] Test filesystem permission and access issues
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation with informative error messages
- [ ] **Standard**: No uncaught exceptions in typical usage

### Documentation & Packaging

#### Documentation Essentials (3-5 days)
- [ ] Complete docstrings for all public classes and methods
- [ ] Add usage examples for core operations (load, scale, save)
- [ ] Create CLI command reference with practical examples
- [ ] Write error codes and troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Set up auto-generated docs with sphinx
- [ ] **Standard**: Professional API documentation

#### User-Facing Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with installation and quickstart
- [ ] Maintain CHANGELOG.md with proper semantic versioning
- [ ] Write contributing guidelines for community participation
- [ ] Create license and security documentation
- [ ] **Goal**: Clear, professional project presentation

### Release Preparation

#### Package Distribution (2-3 days)
- [ ] Verify hatch + hatch-vcs version management
- [ ] Test package building and installation locally
- [ ] Validate entry points and CLI functionality
- [ ] Check dependency specifications and compatibility
- [ ] **Deliverable**: Clean sdist and wheel builds

#### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run final linting and type checking passes
- [ ] Execute test suite with >80% success rate
- [ ] Perform security audit of dependencies
- [ ] Validate performance with typical project files
- [ ] **Milestone**: Production-ready release candidate

## Current Status Tracking

### Issues Resolved
- [x] Package unification completed (legacy camtasia + tscprojpy)
- [x] Core API structure implemented
- [x] Build system configured (hatch + hatch-vcs)
- [x] Effects and annotations systems integrated
- [x] CLI framework established

### Critical Issues Remaining
- [ ] 7 test collection errors (BLOCKING)
- [ ] 182 ruff code style violations (141 auto-fixable)
- [ ] 78 mypy type errors
- [ ] Test coverage unknown due to test failures
- [ ] Documentation incomplete for production use

### Success Criteria for v2025.1.0 Release
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Zero ruff violations
- [ ] <5 mypy errors remaining
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] PyPI package successfully published
- [ ] Installation and basic usage verified

## Future Phases (Post-Production)

### Phase 3: Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Memory optimization for large projects
- [ ] Parallel processing implementation
- [ ] Caching strategies for repeated operations
- [ ] Handle 10,000+ media item projects

### Phase 4: Advanced Features  
- [ ] Expand effects library
- [ ] Timeline manipulation tools
- [ ] Project building API
- [ ] Media intelligence features

### Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] External tool integrations
- [ ] Developer experience improvements
- [ ] Community building
